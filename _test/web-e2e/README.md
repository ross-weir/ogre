# ogre end-to-end testing project

The purpose of this project is to run the `npm` project produced by `ogre` in a real `React` project and probe the nodes running state to ensure it is working as expected in a browser/web environment.

Most development of `ogre` will be done via `deno` and in a native environment so we need some automated testing to ensure the node doesn't break in real web/browser environments.
